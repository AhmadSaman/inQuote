# The Fundamentals

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

> It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis

> We convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action

> if you can get 1 present better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done

> if you get 1 present worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero

> What starts as a small or minor setback accumulates into something much more

> Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement

> The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them

> They seem to make little difference on a any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous

> We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines

> The slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide

> Success is the product of daily habits --<cite>not once-in-a-lifetime transformations</cite>
